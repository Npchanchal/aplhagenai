# 02 — Architecture

**Detailed design (diagrams):** [`docs/ARCHITECTURE_AND_DESIGN.md`](../ARCHITECTURE_AND_DESIGN.md) · **In product:** `/about/architecture`

## Layout

```
backend/app/
  api/routes.py          # thin HTTP
  models/                # Pydantic
  services/              # pure scoring, extract, match, research, auth
  data/                  # seed, hand_labeled, store.json
frontend/src/
  lib/api.ts             # sole HTTP client
  pages/                 # route surfaces (incl. ArchitecturePage)
  components/            # EvidenceTable, TabBar, ChangeChip, …
  i18n/                  # vernacular UI strings
e2e/                     # Playwright
deploy/aws/              # Terraform / ECS
scripts/                 # verify-all, aws-deploy, idle/wake
```

## Layering rules

| Layer | May | Must not |
|---|---|---|
| `services/gci_scoring.py` | Pure math on outcomes | DB, HTTP, time.now side effects |
| `services/repository.py` | Read/write store | Scoring policy |
| `api/routes.py` | Auth, validation, HTTPException | Business formulas |
| `frontend/lib/api.ts` | Typed fetch | Inline fetch in random components |

## Data flow (GCI)

```
IR / transcript / import
  → extract (structured statements, pending)
  → analyst Accept/Edit/Reject → commit
  → match (company_id, period, metric) ↔ actuals
  → compute_company_gci → CompanyGCIDetail
  → UI evidence trail + PIT history
```

## Persistence

Demo/MVP store: JSON under `backend/app/data/` (`store.json`). After hand-label edits, delete `store.json` and rebuild via app/tests.

## Feature flags

See `services/feature_flags.py` — research LLM, consensus import, SSO stubs.

## Price history (context only)

- Optional **Financial Modeling Prep** EOD via `INTELLENS_FMP_API_KEY` / `FMP_API_KEY` (`services/fmp_client.py`).
- Wired into market/index/stock history APIs; **never** into GCI math.
- Free FMP tiers often block India NSE (`.NS`) with HTTP 402 → automatic demo fallback.
- See `.env.example` and `docs/AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md`.
