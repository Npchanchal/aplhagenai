# CiteAlpha Product Portfolio

Parallel product lines that reuse the same India disclosure corpus (filings, concalls, guidance↔actuals, citations) but sell as **different jobs**. GCI remains the brand wedge; these are not tabs pretending to be products.

**Legal entity:** Ocotillo Innovation Private Limited · **Compliance:** factual research tooling — not investment advice; no Buy/Hold/Sell.

## Selection filter

Every SKU must:

1. Use **primary disclosure + evidence**, not news sentiment.
2. Stay **factual** (SEBI-safe posture).
3. Be sellable **without** GCI if the buyer only wants that job.
4. Prefer reuse of: extract → match → cite → review.

## Five commercial bundles

| Bundle | Hero job | Primary buyer | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CiteAlpha Score** | GCI 0–100 + peer delivery benchmarks | Buy-side / sell-side | Live (core) |
| **CiteAlpha Cite** | Mandatory primary citations + Research Terminal | Research ops / AI copilots | Live (core) · API packaging |
| **CiteAlpha Radar** | Guidance change / miss / drop / withdrawal feed | PMs, risk, IR-watch | Live alerts · productize |
| **CiteAlpha Ledger** | Promise ledger / accountability dossier | Compliance, credit, IR, board | Partial (`promise_brief`) · expand |
