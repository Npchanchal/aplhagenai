# AGENTS.md — CiteAlpha

Instructions for Cursor agents working in this repository.

## Mission

Ship a credible **Guidance Credibility Index (GCI)** for Indian equity desks under **CiteAlpha** (Ocotillo Innovation Private Limited): factual, evidence-linked management delivery scores — not sentiment, not Buy/Hold.

## Always

1. Read `docs/kb/00-overview.md` when context is cold.
2. Follow always-on rules `.cursor/rules/citealpha-core.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/index-integrity.mdc`.
3. Pick a specialist from `.cursor/agents/` using `docs/kb/AGENT_ROUTING.md`.
4. Load the matching `.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md` before multi-step work.
5. Prefer small, tested changes; never invent financial actuals **or score history**.
6. Any change that moves a published GCI follows `citealpha-index-integrity` (ledger + changelog).
7. Public copy is for domain experts: rule `public-copy-voice`; canonical names GCI Screener · Analyst Workbench · Filing Search · Disclosure Explorer · Public Snapshot.

## Current programme

`docs/PLAN_WORLDCLASS_GCI.md` — Round-3 review remediation (findings `R3-nn`, workstreams `W1–W9`, gates G-A…G-E). Execute with skill `citealpha-worldclass-remediation`.
